Because of the high traffic peaks (up to 400 unique visitors per minute), a lot of work went into optimising performance. Caching rules in Cloudflare, image resizing and conversion, and the use of ETags, all without affecting the admin experience.

The platform was built for flexibility. It includes an extensive admin panel with logging and configuration tools, integrates with the Crowd Manager and serves as the source of truth for other Student Kick-Off systems.

The Events platform simplifies this process by automating as much as possible through various API integrations. It includes a task management system for adding, removing, and executing tasks, as well as a check system that validates event readiness and notifies organisers of approaching deadlines or status changes.

Crowd Manager provides this by analyzing camera feeds at each entrance and exit. The system detects and tracks visitors, determining whether they’re entering or leaving. After testing several public models, I trained a custom model that significantly improved accuracy.

The data is visualised through a Grafana + Prometheus + Node Exporter dashboard and made available via an API for integration with other tools.

I helped implement a new lap-detection algorithm that determines each runner’s laps from Bluetooth packets and built a live visualiser that estimates the runner’s position in real time.

The data is sent to the frontend for a live visualisation of the race.

Each submission is mounted, executed, and checked against custom test cases provided by professors.
A major part of the work involved sandboxing and security, ensuring that malicious code couldn’t escape the container or affect other systems.
